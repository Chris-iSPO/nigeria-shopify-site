The costs quoted apply to iPhones with 'eligible' damage. Eligible damage is defined as damage caused by defects in materials or workmanship and some forms of accidental damage, which are limited to Liquid damage, LCD fractures and Glass fractures. iStore will still offer repairs to iPhones with ineligible damage at an additional levy of R690. A device with any of the following conditions is ineligible for out-of-warranty service: Third party display, Missing display, Intentional tampering, missing or disassembled parts of the display and Catastrophic damage. Customers booking in their iPhone for a screen replacement must back up their iPhone, turn Find my iPhone off as well as ensure that the iPhone has been charged or is able to switch on at time of booking it in, in order to run diagnostics. It’s imperative that your iPhone is backed-up prior to requesting a screen replacement service as the iPhone will be restored to factory settings and all data will be wiped as part of this repair procedure. The screen repair includes a 90 day warranty or the remainder of your warranty period, whichever is longer.<\/p><p>iStore levies a charge on returns of unsealed products to cover the costs of repackaging the product for sale.
